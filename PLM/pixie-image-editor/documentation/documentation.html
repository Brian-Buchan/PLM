                    	<h2>Pixie Installations & Requirements</h2>

                        <p><strong>Pixie</strong> is a fully javascript based application witch means no installation is needed. Simply upload it to your server and you are done. Any server will do, not requirements for it.</p>
                        <p><strong>Pixie</strong> will most likely work without server as well, by simply opening index.html file with a browser, however several problems might arise due to strict security around using file:// protocol on several browsers, chrome most notably.</p>

                    <section id="basics">
                        <h2>Basic Image Operations</h2>

                        <h3><span class="mark">#</span>Crop</h3>
                        <p>To crop the image click on the corresponding icon in the basics panel. After croping square appears on the image position it where you want by dragging it then click crop to finish.</p>
                        <img src="assets/images/crop-ex.png">

                        <h3><span class="mark">#</span>Rotate</h3>
                        <p>To rotate an image click on the <strong>rotate</strong> icon and use the slider to rotate the image, click apply after you are done.</p>

                        <h3><span class="mark">#</span>Resize</h3>
                        <p>To resize an image click on the <strong>resize</strong> icon and enter the image dimensions you wish to resize to. <strong>constrain proportions</strong> switch will assure that aspect ratio is preserved. You can also use the percentage slider to resize the image by certain percentage while keeping the aspect ratio.</p>

                        <h3><span class="mark">#</span>Round Corners</h3>
                        <p>To round image corners click on the <strong>round</strong> icon, select the radius you want and click apply. Note that currently rounded corners will appear jagged on chrome due to a bug in it so you should use firefox or IE if you need perfectly round corners.</p>

                        <h3><span class="mark">#</span>Color</h3>
                        <p>The color icon will change the canvas background. This will only work if your image doesn't fill the entire canvas.</p>

                        <h3><span class="mark">#</span>Merge</h3>
                        <p><strong>Merge</strong> will merge all the layers/objects, after this they will not be movable or modifiable, but you will be able to apply filters to everything instead of just the images.</p>
